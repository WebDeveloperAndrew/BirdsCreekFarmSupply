            <h3>About us and welcome!</h3>
            <p>First of all, please note that we have re-branded our name to “Birds Creek Farm Supply” Same owners. Same great service but… NEW website. NEW products. Welcome to our new easy to navigate website. This new website is fully viewable on any mobile or tablet. Our history starts in 1960 as Grafs General Store and opened Birds Creek Feed & Hardware ( now Birds Creek Farm Supply ) in 1987 to serve the local farming community and are located just north of Bancroft, Ontario in a small village called Birds Creek. Since our business is ‘family-owned’, you will find that we treat our customers like family as well. This small-town atmosphere and philosophy on how to do business has proven to be very successful, and appreciated by our loyal customers. We supply farm and pet supplies to customers in several little communities in the area including Maynooth, Wilberforce, Harcourt, Cardiff, Combermere, Lake St.Peter, Coe Hill, Gilmour, Maple Leaf, Boulter, McArthurs Mills and other surrounding areas. Over the years our business has grown, and we have a large inventory of animal feed including Non-GMO from Windy Field Farms and some organic from Homestead Organics. We offer pet foods, hardware, tools, clothing and footwear. animal health care products, wood pellets, fencing and more. Our trailers and docks from Interco Fabrication. We also sell live poultry during the spring, summer and fall from Frey’s Hatchery. In the spring we have a green house with flowers and hanging baskets and started vegetable plants. If we don’t have a product or brand you are interested in, we will endeavour to get it in for you. We are always excited to hear about new products, and since many of our customers are experts in their fields, we will often rely on them to let us know if there is something we should be carrying.</p>
