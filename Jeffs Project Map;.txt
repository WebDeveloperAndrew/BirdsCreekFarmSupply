Image Server --- we need an image server to store all images related
to producs and brands, this image server can be its own module but 
will be a core component. This should be easy, image servers we have
worked with before, this doesn't need to do anything extravagant like
store things on google.

Image Server uploads, when should they happen? Progress Bars? Look at
previous work for references here. This can probably happen in the
brand/product creation page. We can potentially use an image library
if needed.

Login Server --- we need a login server that can serve login tokens
all requests must have a valid token, no requests without one. This
is complicated but also foundational to what happens next.

Pages --- Many pages need to be created with html and css, these pages
can be finished either during before or after the backend. 

Revamping the entire system to use IDs will take a short period of 
time and can be done whenever.

Adding and removing brand pages are the simplest task and should be 
done first since there are reliant systems. The id change can happen
later.
